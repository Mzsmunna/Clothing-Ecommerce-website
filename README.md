# Clothing-Ecommerce-website
It's a Ecommerce website, has been build with using Node.js & JavaScript in 2018. It's the same but a mini version of the Ecommerce Website that I have developed along with one my friend using Laravel. Actually this is the Pre build version of that project. It contains pretty basic functionality with user and admin panel. user can search and purchase product, wheather Admin can add,update,delete,search product. This Project contains very less feature comparing the Laravel built.

MySQL Database has been used. And MVC structure has been followed. 

To run this on your machine , make sure Node.js is installed and import c_d.sql in PHPMyAdmin. And you are good to go.
